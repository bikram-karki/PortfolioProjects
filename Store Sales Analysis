I analysed the sales data of an American superstore to identify various sales trends based on the revenue generated by month, state, age, gender and region. Through this analysis, I intended to provide stakeholders with the information about the sales performance of the store across multiple product categories. These insights based on the key sales metrics ensures that stakeholders can make strategies on increasing sales revenue and growing customers.

​

Key Insights:

​Highest Sales Regions: Analysing the nationwide store sales data, I identified key insights about the regions and states that generate the highest sales revenue for the store. Using these information, the stakeholders can prioritize these regions and add more store outlets that drive sales numbers higher.

​Gender-wise Sales Analysis : I visualized the sales revenue for each product category based on gender to highlight the product categories preferred most by male and female customers. This helps stakeholders to understand gender-based purchase preferences so that they can increase sales by targeting those customers with multi-buy discounts.

Quantity-Discount Correlation: I compared the quantity of ordered products with the discount amount on those products to find out their correlation. With this correlation graph, stakeholders get a better understanding about customer preferring to order more quantity of products if they are offered high discounts.   This information helps stakeholders to decide on offering high discounts for low-selling products to raise higher revenue.

​Age-based Sales: The analysis on the sales revenue per age group provides valuable insights on the age demographic that purchase the most across their stores. The stakeholders can make use of this information to understand the age group they should focus more on selling products. Also, the stores can adopt strategies to attract more customers from each age group by offering age-appropriate offers or discount coupons.
